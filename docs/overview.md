## **Project Development Plan: Command-Line Tool for Inspecting File Trees**

### **1. Project Overview**

**Objective**:  
Build a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool that can:  
- Analyze directory structures (file trees) recursively.  
- Detect duplicate files and similar/duplicate routes (directory patterns).  
- Identify discrepancies (missing files, orphaned files, inconsistent naming).  
- Generate a visual file tree map.  
- Offer context-specific best practices and organizational suggestions.  
- Export results (e.g., JSON, YAML) for integration with other tools or CI/CD pipelines.

**Why This Matters**:  
This tool simplifies complex file management tasks. By providing both a high-level visual map and in-depth analysis (e.g., duplicates, discrepancies, best practice recommendations), it helps developers, project managers, and even general users maintain an organized and efficient file structure. This is especially valuable in large codebases or datasets where manual inspection is time-consuming.

### **2. Key Features and Requirements**

1. **Duplicate File Detection**  
   - **Goal**: Identify files with identical content via hash-based comparisons.  
   - **Value**: Reduces redundancy, saves storage space, streamlines codebases.

2. **Duplicate Route and Structure Analysis**  
   - **Goal**: Spot similar or redundant directory structures (e.g., `src/utils/` vs. `lib/utils/`).  
   - **Value**: Maintains a logical, consistent directory layout.

3. **Discrepancy Identification**  
   - **Goal**: Flag missing files, orphaned files, and inconsistent naming conventions.  
   - **Value**: Ensures files align with organizational standards and best practices.

4. **Visual File Tree Map**  
   - **Goal**: Generate a visual (e.g., ASCII-based) representation of the directory structure, highlighting duplicates and discrepancies.  
   - **Value**: Offers quick, high-level insight into file organization and problem areas.

5. **Context-Specific Insights & Best Practices**  
   - **Goal**: Provide recommendations based on project type or configuration (e.g., suggesting modularization for a web app, naming conventions for a Python package).  
   - **Value**: Enhances project quality and maintainability by aligning structure with recognized standards.

6. **Exportable Output**  
   - **Goal**: Output results in structured formats (JSON, YAML) for reporting, CI/CD integration, or archival.  
   - **Value**: Facilitates automation and integration with other tools in the development pipeline.

### **3. System Architecture and Dependencies**

**Programming Language**: Python (3.8+ recommended)

**Core Libraries and Dependencies**:  
- **File Operations and Hashing**: `os`, `hashlib`  
- **CLI Parsing**: `argparse`  
- **Visualization**: `rich` for tree rendering and CLI aesthetics  
- **Data Serialization**: `json`, `yaml` (using `PyYAML`) for export functionality

**Configuration Files**:  
- Optional `config.json` or `config.yaml` to provide project context (e.g., project type, naming conventions, exclusion patterns).

**Data Flow**:  
1. **Input**:  
   - Target directory path (provided as a CLI argument).
   - Optional project configuration file for context.
   
2. **Processing**:  
   - Recursively traverse the directory, compute file hashes, identify duplicates, detect route discrepancies, and apply context rules.
   
3. **Output**:  
   - Visual tree printed to the console.
   - Analytical results (duplicates, discrepancies, suggestions) printed or exported to JSON/YAML.

---

### **4. Implementation Roadmap**

**Phase 1: Basic Foundation (1-2 Weeks)**  
- Set up project structure (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `examples/`).  
- Implement CLI using `argparse` for directory input and optional configuration file.  
- Implement file traversal using `os.walk`.  
- Compute file hashes (`sha256`) to identify duplicates.  
- Store found files in a hash map to track duplicates.

**Deliverables**:  
- Basic CLI that accepts a directory and prints a list of files and duplicates (if any).

**Milestone Check**:  
- Can run the tool on a small test directory and see output in the console.  
- Detect duplicates accurately.

---

**Phase 2: Enhanced Analysis (2-3 Weeks)**  
- Implement logic to detect duplicate or similar directory routes.  
- Add discrepancy detection:
  - Identify missing files (based on a reference config or template).
  - Detect orphaned or unused files if applicable.
  - Highlight naming inconsistencies.
- Introduce a visual file tree map using `rich.tree`.

**Deliverables**:  
- Visual tree output with annotations for duplicates and discrepancies.  
- Internal data structures to store and report on identified issues.

**Milestone Check**:  
- Run on a sample project and see a tree output with highlights and a summary of issues.

---

**Phase 3: Contextual Insights and Best Practices (2-3 Weeks)**  
- Incorporate a configuration file parser (`config.json` or `config.yaml`).  
- Based on the config:
  - Suggest better file naming conventions.
  - Identify files that donâ€™t match expected patterns (e.g., `.py` modules in `modules/` directory).
  - Provide project-type-specific recommendations (e.g., for a Python web app, suggest placing templates in a `templates/` folder).
- Implement logic to generate actionable suggestions.

**Deliverables**:  
- Configurable advice engine that tailors recommendations to the project context.

**Milestone Check**:  
- Provide a sample `config.yaml` and see the output recommendations change based on project type.

---

**Phase 4: Reporting and Integration (1-2 Weeks)**  
- Implement exporting of results in JSON or YAML format for automated reporting.  
- Include detailed information (duplicate file mappings, discrepancy lists, and recommendations) in the output file.  
- Optionally integrate with CI/CD by printing exit codes or generating machine-readable outputs.

**Deliverables**:  
- Ability to run `tool.py directory/ --export results.json` and get structured output.

**Milestone Check**:  
- Verify JSON/YAML output accuracy and completeness.

---

**Phase 5: Optimization, Testing, and Polish (2 Weeks)**  
- Optimize performance for large directories (consider multiprocessing if needed).  
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests:
  - Test hashing and duplicate detection logic.
  - Test discrepancy detection with controlled test scenarios.
  - Test contextual insights using multiple configurations.
- Add documentation (README, usage guides, docstrings).

**Deliverables**:  
- Well-tested, documented codebase.
- Performance improvements where necessary.

**Milestone Check**:  
- Passing test suite and clear documentation.  
- Stable performance on large directories.

### **5. Testing Strategy**

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Hashing functions.
  - Route and discrepancy detection logic.
  - Configuration file parsing and recommendation engine.

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Run against a known directory structure with intentional duplicates and discrepancies.
  - Validate that the output matches expected results (e.g., known duplicates, known missing files).

- **Performance/Stress Tests**:
  - Test on large directories (tens of thousands of files) to ensure acceptable performance.

- **Configuration Variation Tests**:
  - Test with various `config.json` or `config.yaml` files to ensure context-sensitive logic works correctly.
